	<entry name="NonAggressionPactRejected" value="&quot;Nah, I prefer my soldiers to be on edge. Makes them harder. Stronger.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="NonAggressionPactTerminated" value="&quot;To be frank, I was thinking it was about time. Time for some troop exercises at the borders.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferAlliance" value="&quot;Soldier! There's no such thing as an army of one. Your ally needs you.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferNonAggressionPact" value="&quot;I can't believe I'm offering this but... how about we don't shoot at each other. For now. And yes, I'm having a weak moment.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferPeace" value="&quot;That was an outstanding war! How about a short ceasefire to let the soldiers visit their families?&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferResearchPact" value="&quot;Should we share our research efforts? We've got some amazing new guns.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferTradingPact" value="&quot;How about a sweet trade pact? You'll really want some of these huggable doll-mines -- I heard they make excellent toys for children.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="PeaceAccepted" value="&quot;Was an awful lot of bloodshed these past few years, I agree.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="TerminateResearchPact" value="&quot;The scientific profit from our research pact is too one-sided, so I'm canceling it.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TerminateTradingPact" value="&quot;To be frank, I think our trading pact is simply not profitable enough for us, and hereby nullified.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TradingPactAccepted" value="&quot;Ah sure, why not. But do not try to smuggle any weapons. Unless it's to me.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TradingPactRejected" value="&quot;I know our guns are sought after, but giving them to everyone would make them, well, less exclusive. I hope you understand...&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TradingPactTerminated" value="&quot;I see this is an insult to my integrity. Watch your step, %2%.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="WarAccepted" value="&quot;%2%, you must have lost your sanity to challenge me. Once I have dealt with your laughable army, I will personally take a C-X Flesheater and shove it down your throat.&quot;"/>
