	<entry name="FirstContact" value="&quot;May I introduce myself? I am Doctor Alpheus Schreiber, nominal head of Togra University. It was our creations, such as the Alcubierre drive, that brought man to Pandora. Given that, I don't think you grudge us a chance to research this fascinating new world and to expand the borders of human thought, would you? I thought not. I can see we're going to get along... famously.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="LetMeThink" value="&quot;Hmm... give me a moment to think about it.&quot;"/> 
	<entry name="LetMeKnow" value="&quot;Sure, just let me know once you have made your decision.&quot;"/>

	<!-- Dialogue partner wants to know who and what. -->
	<entry name="AcceptDenounceThirdParty0" value="&quot;Really? Why would anyone do that? We don't mean to hurt anyone. Except in the course of research.&quot;"/> 
	<!-- Dialogue partner is not interested. -->
	<entry name="RejectDenounceThirdParty0" value="&quot;Excuse me, I'm rather busy. These rats won't eviscerate themselves.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="AcceptDenounceThirdParty1" value="&quot;Really? I'll put that in my notes. Most fascinating. Thank you again.&quot;"/> 
	<!-- Dialogue partner dismisses it. -->
	<entry name="RejectDenounceThirdParty1" value="&quot;Why would anyone do that? We're scientists. It's like kicking puppies, outside of a correct puppy-kicking trial. I jest, of course.&quot;"/>
	
	<!-- Demands from dialogue partner to cancel trading and research pacts with a third faction. -->
	<entry name="DemandSanctionsAgainstThirdParty0" value="&quot;We know about your pacts and, our medium-term predictions for you aren't good if you carry them on. I wouldn't dare ask about the long-term if I were you... &quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptSanctionsAgainstThirdParty0" value="&quot;Well, I suppose we don't need help to do research. But we do for trade. Hmm, who?&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectSanctionsAgainstThirdParty0" value="&quot;You know the rumours about my IQ - are you sure you want to attempt such blatant manipulation with me?&quot;"/>

	<!-- Offers dialogue partner to share explored territories. -->
	<entry name="OfferShareMap" value="&quot;Our data analysis labs has made some beautiful 11 dimensional maps, though they do always end up looking a bit like torii - donuts to you. We could render them down to a 2D form, if you wanted to understand a fragment of what we do.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptShareMap" value="&quot;We're just downscaling it - the 1:1 data scale will probably fritz your old Earth-based computers.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectShareMap" value="&quot;The AI resources of old Earth could just about comprehend our map. I'm not sure an ape like you would know whether to eat it or mate with it.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="OfferOpenBorders" value="&quot;Shall we loosen our border restrictions? We already know everything you've got, anyway.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptOpenBorders" value="&quot;Of course, you're welcome in. Just avoid the testing zones. You'll know when you're in them, because you won't exist any more.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectOpenBorders" value="&quot;The very concept of borders is so outmoded in this post-nation state society, that your request makes no sense. I'd encourage you not to cross them all the same.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TerminateOpenBorders" value="&quot;We've started field tests on weapons that must not end up in the wrong hands -- so in an effort to minimize the dangers of espionage, I hereby terminate our agreement on open borders. My apologies, %1%.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptOpenBordersTerminated" value="&quot;I hope the real reason is not that you're afraid we would steal your technology, because let me assure you my dear %1%, that is never going to happen.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="AcceptDenounce" value="&quot;Yes, yes. That was us. And we'd do it again. You can't possibly understand our reasons. And I can prove that.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectDenounce" value="&quot;What do you think we are, mad scientists? You may consider our precepts mad, but our ratiocination is provably perfect (or it would be, save for cursed Gödel.)&quot;"/>

	<entry name="RejectPraise" value="&quot;There's a 97.34%% chance you're flattering us to get something. How... cute.&quot;"/>
	
	<!-- Offers surrender. -->
	<entry name="OfferSurrender" value="&quot;Well, sadly, I predicted this from the start. But our master plan will come to fruition soon enough. In the meantime, we'd like to surrender to you.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptSurrender" value="&quot;Yes, yes, just put it in the in-tray. Welcome aboard.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectSurrender" value="&quot;No, we don't have the teachers available to teach quantum synchronistic infundubula to your entire population, and it would be pointless you attempting to enter our society without knowing the basics.&quot;"/>

	<!-- Demands tribute. -->
	<entry name="DemandTribute0" value="&quot;You know, a little bit of money to our research efforts, will mean that we won't try our evolutionary tests on you.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TributeAccepted0" value="&quot;I'm sure I can skim some off the pointless commercial projects - there's money here for frictionless shower curtains. How much do you need?&quot;"/>
