	<entry name="OfferCredits1" value="&quot;As FDR said, forests are the lungs of the world. Here's %6% <icon texture='Resources/Credits'/> to stop you chopping them down.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferCredits2" value="&quot;We figure if we give you %6% <icon texture='Resources/Credits'/> credits, you might kill all the other humans - which, in my opinion, would make Gaia-Pandora very happy.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferCredits3" value="&quot;Wow, you're in a bad way, but I can't afford more than %6% <icon texture='Resources/Credits'/> credits to help you out. Be good!&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AllianceAccepted" value="&quot;Oh yes! Together we can make sure the sins of Old Earth won't happen again.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AllianceRejected" value="&quot;Thank you, but your ideology is too, shall we say, unconventional for my taste. No offense...&quot;"/>

	<entry name="NonAggressionPactTerminated" value="&quot;Ha, so what's next on your list? Declare war?&quot;"/>
	<entry name="OfferAlliance" value="&quot;For the good of Earth and Pandora, let us fight together!&quot;"/>

	<entry name="ResearchPactTerminated" value="&quot;Do you really think this was the right decision, %2%? I doubt it.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TerminateAlliance" value="&quot;I hope you don't misread this gesture my old friend, but our alliance is terminated -- effective immediately.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TerminateNonAggressionPact" value="&quot;Things are starting to go too far -- our non-aggression pact is hereby nullified.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TerminateResearchPact" value="&quot;We do not like the polluting path your research is taking. Our pact is hereby nullified.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="WithdrawalAccepted" value="&quot;I don't know how our people got there -- probably following Gaia's dream -- but I'll call them home.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="WithdrawalRejected" value="&quot;By what right? They walk among the animals, where you stomp and bloody the earth. They will not move.&quot;"/>
